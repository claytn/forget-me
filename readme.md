### forget-me

> A chrome extension that opens a set list of websites in an incognito window.

Motivation: Many news sites and blog sites track a ton of personal info and have limits on the amount of content you can view if they remember your browser. I found myself copying and pasting a lot of urls into an incognito window to avoid this and decided it would be nice to automate for my most popular viewed sites.

As of version `0.1` the only site I've added support for is medium.com. Will be adding an interface for adding your own site list (soon hopefully)
